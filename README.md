# REST-and-GRAPHQL
REST(without DRF) and GraphQL

>I've built RESTful API without using DRF, it's based on pure Django and at the same time in another app I've built GraphQL endpoint.
>There are lot of things to be implemented like authentication[0Auth, JWT], throttling, pagination etc. which you can build using DRF with just few line of codes.[I worked on this project just for fun purpose just want
enhance my skills.]
